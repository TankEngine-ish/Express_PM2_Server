# Express_PM2_Server

Express_PM2_Server was a simple project that was all about getting familiar with a load balancer. In my case the PM2.
This is a tool that was build upon the functionality of the cluster module in Node.js.

It introduced me to a variety of topics such as horizontal and vertical scaling, the round-robin approach,
zero down-time restarts, the difference between worker threads and clustering and when it's more appropriate to use one or the other, etc.

The servers in the process list correspond to the amount of the logical cores of my CPU (12).
